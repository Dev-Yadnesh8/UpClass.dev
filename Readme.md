# CodeVerse

## About

CodeVerse is a fullstack project where I will build a Learning Management System (LMS) platform.  
It includes both frontend and backend parts to practice real-world web development skills like CRUD operations, authentication, and API handling.  

The goal is to create a solid, functional app that can be expanded and improved over time.
