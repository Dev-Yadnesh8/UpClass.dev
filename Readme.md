# UpClass.dev

## About

**UpClass.dev** is a full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) platform built to practice and demonstrate real-world web development skills.  
The project includes both frontend and backend components and focuses on essential features such as:

- Authentication & Authorization  
- Course purchasing and progress tracking  
- Responsive and interactive UI  
- Token-based session management  
- RESTful API integrations  

## Motivation

This project is a part of my learning journey to deepen my understanding of:

- Full-stack application architecture  
- State management and secure API communication  
- Clean code practices and modular structure  
- Real-world use cases like content gating, dynamic UI rendering, and user roles  

The goal is to not only build a functioning LMS but to shape a robust and scalable app that reflects production-level quality, all while learning and applying key concepts hands-on.

Stay tuned as the project continues to evolve.
