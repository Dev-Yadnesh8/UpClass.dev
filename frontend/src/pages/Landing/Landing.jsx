              UpClass.dev is a modern learning platform built to empower
              independent educators, developers, and creators to build, launch,
              and scale their own online course businesses â€” without needing to
              be tech experts.
              <br />
              <br />
              Founded by a developer passionate about learning by building,
              UpClass.dev is more than just software â€” itâ€™s a platform that
              simplifies course creation while encouraging hands-on,
              project-based learning. Whether you're teaching frontend, backend,
              design, or dev tools, we give you full control and a beautiful
              experience for both you and your learners.
              <br />
              <br />
              Weâ€™re on a mission to make professional education accessible,
              creator-first, and completely customizable â€” because every
              educator deserves the tools to teach the world in their own way.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
              Our vision is to empower a new generation of creators, mentors,
              and developers to own their teaching platforms, share their
              knowledge at scale, and build sustainable careers doing what they
              love.
              <br />
              <br />
              We believe in democratizing edtech â€” giving independent
              instructors the same tools and design power as big course
              platforms, but without the gatekeeping. With UpClass.dev, anyone
              can turn their knowledge into impact.
              <br />
              <br />
              As we grow, we remain committed to open learning, modern tools,
              and building a supportive ecosystem for both educators and
              learners. This isnâ€™t just a product â€” itâ€™s a movement to make
              learning and teaching more personal, powerful, and accessible.
